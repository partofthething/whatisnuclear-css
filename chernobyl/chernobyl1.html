          <h1>Chernobyl as I see it 20 years later</h1>                            
          <h3>By Natallia Pinchuk, Feb 2007</h3>
        <h6>About the Author</h6>
        <p>"I didn't learn about the Chernobyl catastrophe in the morning newspaper - I lived through it. In the country of my birth, Belarus, Chernobyl sundered time into two pieces: <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>." That was the opening statement of my undergrad admission essay, after which I described the horrible events of the Chernobyl and how it dramatically affected me, my family and the local population. Three years later, when I was just a few months away from graduating with a Master's degree in Nuclear Engineering I saw those events in a different light. One might say that I was brainwashed, or one might say that I finally learned about what really happened at Chernobyl. The latter makes me wonder about millions of other people, affected or not affected at all by Chernobyl, who still live in fear and misunderstanding.</p>
      <h6>Common perceptions of the Chernobyl accident</h6>
       <p>The accident at Chernobyl was certainly a catastrophe, but not that kind of a catastrophe that you might imagine. It is usually thought of as a horrible accident - a nuclear explosion of a power-generating reactor releasing thousands of tons of dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of grave sicknesses, and countless cases of deformity. Before you form this grotesque way image, let's first straighten out the facts: </p>
       <ul>
       <li>It was not a nuclear explosion[<strong onmouseover="domTT_activate(this, event, 'width','200','caption', 'Note', 'content', 'Reactors cannot cause nuclear explosion the way nuclear weapons do, even with such poor designs as the Chernobyl reactor was. It is just physically impossible!','trail', true);">*</strong>] - it was a steam explosion (water was used in the reactor as coolant and once it overheated, water flashed into steam under high pressure and blew the lid off of the reactor). </li>
       <li>Two workers died immediately after the explosion (from the explosion, not radiation)</li>
       <li>203 firefighters, plant personnel and emergency workers were hospitalized, 29 of whom died shortly either from burns received during the fire or from acute radiation sickness. (more info on radiation sickness at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_sickness">Radiation Sickness [Wikipedia]</a>.
       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>These 31 casualties were the only deaths that we can be 100% sure claimed by Chernobyl; not thousand or hundreds - 31[<strong onmouseover="domTT_activate(this, event, 'width','200','caption', 'Note', 'content', 'You might see a different number depending on the source of information. That does not mean that the sources disagree between each other, most of the time it simply means that the deaths were recorded at different dates. For example, as of August 31, 1986 31 people died, but if you are looking at report that was made before August you can see a smaller number. The highest number I have ever seen was 38 (report as of 1996).','trail', true);">*</strong>]!</p>
	   <h6>Short-term health effects of the released radiation</h6>
       
       <ul>
        <li>134 workers were clinically confirmed to have radiation sickness.</li>
        <li>134,000 people from the 30km zone received less than 25 rem of radiation, which causes no detectible effects according to OSEH. </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Long-term health effects of released radiation</h6>
		<p>
Now here comes the controversial part. The problem with long term consequences is that when a person dies from a cancer 30 years after the accident, it is really hard to tell whether he/she got that cancer because of the radiation exposure or if he/she was going to get it no matter what. One might say that if there is an increase of cancer deaths in the region than it might be attributed to the radiation exposure. However, showing any kind of increase in cancer deaths due to radiation exposure is not as easy as it might seem. It requires not only detailed studies of all population that was exposed after the accident over their life times, but also the same study for population before the accident. There are no good statistics for the population group in that particular region before the accident. Also there are a lot of people who moved away from the area after the accident and therefore would not contribute to any kind of statistical studies after the accident. And the last part is that we don't know how would the cancer rate change (remain the same/increase/decrease) in the region if the accident would not happen.</p>

<p>Given the reasons above one can basically claim anything: all cancer deaths in that region are due to accident, none were caused by the accident. The truth is however somewhere in between. Below are the numbers that are commonly accepted by the scientific community:</p>

<ul>
       <li>As of 2006, 3,940 cancer deaths are attributed to the affects of radiation exposure from Chernobyl accident.</li>
        <li>About 4,000 thyroid cancers were diagnosed in the period of 1996-2002 in children and adolescents. However, these cancers were easily diagnosed and 98% curable (only 15 deaths were registered) </li>
       <li>Additional 4,000 cancer deaths are projected for 5-6 million people who lived and/or still living in the low contaminated areas (that's less then 1%)[<strong onmouseover="domTT_activate(this, event, 'width','200','caption', 'Note', 'content', 'These numbers are calculated from the models which are based on Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivor data. Given the fact that Chernobyl and Hiroshima and Nagasaki events were very dissimilar (one is low level long term chronic radiation exposure and the other is high short term acute exposure) the estimates might not be accurate.','trail', true);">*</strong>] . </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the accident was a tragedy, killing up to 8,000 people over 40 years or so, but it certainly did not wipe out everyone around. Why was there a global panic? The Soviet government tried to conceal the accident as long as they could. When there is no information, people tend to imagine the most horrible outcome possible - that's just human nature. Even after some information was released to the Western world under pressure, local people were left in wonder, which worsen the situation even more. That's what triggered such a tremendous overreaction in the first place. Well, now we seemed to have all information, why do people still freak out about it then? Well, another good question. The second factor is radiation. It's sad to admit, but people all over the globe, not only in Eastern Europe, are very poorly educated on what radiation really is and what it can and cannot do to people's health. Besides that, you can't see radiation, you can't smell or feel it. You have no way of knowing whether it's there or not (at least in case of medium or low doses). So basically you're being attacked by an invisible undetectable monster! Anyone would be terrified! </p>

<h6>Governmental handling</h6>
<p>To say that the USSR government did not handle the situation well would be an understatement (read more about USSR trying to cover up the accident and causing even more panic, mistrust, and frustration in the population at <a href="http://www.nea.fr/html/rp/reports/2006/stakeholders_preprint.pdf">[The NEA]</a>).
Poor design and operation of RBMK (there were six operating procedure violations at Chernobyl reactor. If at least one of those did not happen, then the accident could have been avoided. <a href="http://www.ans.org/pi/matters/chernobyl/docs/nn-1986-9-chernobyl-hires.pdf">[ANS]</a></p>

<h6>Contamination with radioactive nuclides </h6>
<p>
Which nuclides were of the most concern? Cs-137, Sr-90, I-131 and Pu-239 are the most dangerous contaminants. Cs-137 and Sr-90 both have half-lives of about 30 years, and are dangerous because they are easily mistaken by the body for Potassium and Calcium respectively; although I-131 has a half live of about 8 days it is volatile and easily accumulated in thyroids causing considerable dose to the organ; Pu-239 is not as dangerous unless inhaled or ingested. However it has a very long half life of about 24,000 years, which means it will be around for generations to come. More at <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fisfrag.html#c5">[Hyperphysics]</a>)</p>

<h6>Chernobyl - lessons learned</h6> 
<p>Chernobyl transformed safety culture in nuclear industry. Since then there have been dramatic changes both to the reactor designs and operational procedures to make nuclear power production inherently safe. Read more at http://www.nea.fr/html/rp/chernobyl/c09.html
</p>
<p>
There have been many books, articles, pictures, videos and movies produced about Chernobyl by scientists, environmental activists, governmental organizations and artists whose goals sometimes are not very easily identifiable, and whose stories are not always based on facts, but rather emotions and rumors. Who wants to read a paper about not very harmful radiation after all? However a movie about hundreds of mutant dying children will definitely sell! So the goal I set to myself while writing this article is to point the reader to the references based on solid facts and scientific research, and warn about common misconceptions.
